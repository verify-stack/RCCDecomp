# RCCDecomp
This is a partial decompilcation attempt of a ROBLOX legacy binary dated from May 13, 2008. The decompilcation may be scuffed because this is my first time doing this.

## What
RCCService is a service that ROBLOX still uses today to host gameservers and take thumbnails. This version is a legacy Windows version, as ROBLOX now hosts their servers on Linux.

## Requirements
* Visual Studio 2005
* Visual C++ 8
